# E-commerce React Application
Hello! This is a React application that was bootstrapped with Create-React-App. It uses various Firebase services including Cloud Storage, Firestore, and Firebase Authentication.

# Used Libraries and Technologies
- Material UI

# Steps to run
If you want to run the project locally all you need to do is:
